This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

* Followed guide from [Android Native Module](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android) to add **Android native modules**
* Researched on **CameraX** usage in Native Android
* Researched on React Native New Architecture **Turbo Modules** & **Fabric components**, but opt to not use it in the end.
* Researched on how to add Native Android code and classes, mainly to open a new Android Activity with native kotlin code
* Managed to integrate Native CameraX code into base React Native Project by using React Native, Native Modules capabilities to start an Android Native Activity containing Kotlin code

Run project as per normal using `yarn start`, then open in android emulator, so far tested on emulator, video as follows
